This is a Demo Project where I used basic concepts of AWS and Terraform to create a basic AWS Infrastructure.
Upon successful run, this configuration should create:
1. One VPC with one Route Table, Two Subnets, Two Security Groups, One Internet Gateway
2. Two instances i.e. one in Public subnet and another one in Private subnet
3. Apache will be installed on both of the public subnets
4. A local provisioner will run to output Public ips of the subnets
5. One Application Load Balancer that will balance the incpoming traffic between two public instances
6. A child module and using that a S3 bucket will be created
7. Output a number of required parameters
Please use own access key and secret key or any other methods of storing environment variables while running. Above mentioned keys are not usable.
